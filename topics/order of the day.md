You are invited to join us at the Barn at Berryfields on Saturday 10th August 2024 for our wedding reception. We are getting married in a small family ceremony at Solihull registery office in the morning.

The day will begin early afternoon when we will gather for a sit-down lunch in the private function room of the venue. Following lunch we will wander out to the Teepee where there is a bar that overlooks the fields.
