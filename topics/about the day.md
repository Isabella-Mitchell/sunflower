You are invited to join us at the Barn at Berryfields on Saturday 10th August 2024.

The day will begin early afternoon when we will gather for a sit-down lunch in the private function room of the venue. Following lunch we will wander out to the Teepee where there is a bar that overlooks the fields. As night falls there will be an evening buffet to make sure no one has any space left before we say our goodbyes.

We strongly advise driving or taking a taxi to and from the venue. While the map does show it is within walking distance of the town of Meriden, this is a narrow fast country lane with no footpath.

The full venue address is: The Barn at Berryfields, Berryfields Farm, Berkswell Rd, Meriden, Coventry CV7 7LB.

You can find out more about the venue on the [Barn at Berryfields website](https://www.thebarnatberryfields.co.uk/).
