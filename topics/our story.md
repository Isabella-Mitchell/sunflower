For those of you that don't know, our story first began in 2019 when we met on internet dating. We were both living in North London at the time and Izzy had made it clear she was keen to meet someone to explore the local area with. We began talking and decided to meet up one fateful Sunday morning for a coffee date...

_The first time I met Matt in person, he was standing in a book shop on Stoke Newington High St. After first saying hello, we went to a coffee shop and then for brunch. We had a great time although he did seem a little caught off guard when we ran into some of his friends._

Flash forward to March 2020 and the world was thrown into disarray by events outside of our control. It was during this most turbulent of times that I made the second best decision of my life, to move in with Izzy. We figured that if we could survive that together, we could survive anything.

_Out the other side of lockdown, Matt and I decided we would make the move permanent. Things were great but with all the chaos of the last few years, we realised we'd never had the chance to go on holiday abroad just the two of us. To get the ball rolling, I booked us Eurostar tickets to Gent in Belgium in July 2023._

Once the Holiday was booked, I went on to make the best decision of my life. I asked Izzy to marry me at approximately 1:00am on 7th July 2023, her birthday. We'd been at the Jazz Festival until fairly late and were crossing the bridge on the way back to where we were staying, the city was quiet and the moment felt right.

_Since that moment we have been looking forward to tying the knot officially. We can't wait to share our wedding day with you and bring our closest loved ones under one roof._

Lots of Love, Matt & Izzy
