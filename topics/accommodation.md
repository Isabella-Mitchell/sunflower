For those who are coming from further afield, we can recommend staying in the following areas:

**Birmingham International/ Birmingham Airport** – Offers a wide choice of chain hotels. Ideal for travelling by train to London and Birmingham City Centre. An 11 minute drive to the venue.

**Birmingham City Centre** – Good for an extended stay to take in all the sights. Approximately 45 minute drive from the venue. Or a 11 minute drive from the venue to Birmingham International and then a 20 minute train to Birmingham New Street.

**Meriden, Hampton-in-Arden and the surrounding areas** – Enjoy a more rural retreat with a choice of inns, guesthouses and manor hotels. Anywhere between 5-20 minute drive to the venue.

If you would like further advice or recommendations, please do reach out. The Wedding Party will be staying in Coleshill close to Matthew’s family home.
